Customer Attrition Prediction 

üìå Project Overview

Customer attrition (churn) is a major concern for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on various factors like tenure, usage frequency, support calls, and payment delays.

We use multiple classification models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, and apply ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy.
